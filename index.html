He was the first contemporary writer of horror and science fiction in the Arabic speaking world and also the first writer to explore the medical thriller genre.

        Born on 10 June 1962 in the northern Egyptian city of Tanta,Tawfik graduated from Tanta University's medical school in 1985.[8] He attained a PhD in 1997. In 1992, he joined the Modern Arab Association publishing company and began writing his first series of novels the following year .January 1993, he published the first installment in his horror/thriller series Ma Waraa Al Tabiaa (Arabic: ما وراء الطبيعة‎), which translates to Beyond nature or "Metaphysics". He also wrote periodical articles for journals and web-based magazines such as El Destoor and Rewayty. His writing style appealed to both Egyptian and broader Arabic-speaking audiences, gaining him popularity in Egypt and the Middle East.

Tawfik's novels typically feature all Egyptian characters and are set both in Egypt and around the world. Some of his characters are semi-autobiographical. Tawfik draws from personal experiences in their creation; fans consider him their "godfather" and identify him most closely with his character Refaat Ismael, who is featured in the Ma Waraa Al Tabiaa series.His book Utopia may even reflect Egypt as it is becoming, with rich and poor and no middle-class.
